# Uber Fare Analysis using Python and Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Uber Fare Analysis** project! In this repository, we leverage Python libraries and machine learning techniques to analyze Uber fare data. The goal is to gain insights and predictions from the provided dataset.

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing Uber fare data using Python's data manipulation libraries and machine learning algorithms. We aim to uncover patterns, relationships, and predict fare amounts based on the provided dataset.

## Setup

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git`

2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook `Uber_Fare_Analysis.ipynb`.

## Data Analysis

In this section, we utilize libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform exploratory data analysis on the Uber fare dataset. We examine factors influencing fare amounts and visualize key insights.

## Machine Learning

We employ machine learning techniques, specifically Linear Regression, to build a predictive model for Uber fares. Using the dataset's features, we train the model to predict fare amounts accurately.

## Results

Our analysis provides valuable insights into the relationship between various factors and Uber fare amounts. The machine learning model's predictions offer a reliable estimate of fare costs based on input features.

## Dependencies

The project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

Let's delve into Uber fare analysis using Python and machine learning to gain valuable insights!
